# Opening

Ops Map is a Manifest V3 browser extension that replaces the default new-tab page with a compact operating board for active work. The system is designed for immediate orientation: when a tab opens, the user should see campaign intent, current mission text, and actionable project entries without panning, dragging, or restoring layout state from memory. The architecture therefore optimizes for structural clarity first and visual novelty second.

The current interface intentionally abandons free-form spatial mapping in favor of a fixed six-slot board. This shift is not cosmetic; it changes the system contract. The board now assumes a maximum of six campaigns, and each campaign occupies a deterministic section. By constraining placement, the runtime eliminates overlap failure modes and keeps reading order stable even when projects belong to multiple campaigns.

Persistence remains local-first with synchronized extension storage where available. Shared map data is saved in `chrome.storage.sync`, while machine-specific behavior such as link launch target remains local to each installation. Because Chrome scopes sync payloads by extension identity, this repository now pins a stable extension public key in `manifest.json` so unpacked installs resolve to one shared ID across devices. Cross-browser continuity is still handled through explicit export/import, and a separate Google Sync module exists as a scaffold for future cloud-backed synchronization.
The current presentation layer adopts a typographic editorial direction with a monochrome palette: off-white surfaces, black ink tones, Garamond-led typography, and hand-drawn-style campaign outlines. This keeps the UI visually quiet while still giving container boundaries a human, sketched character.

# Ontology

The core entity is the campaign. A campaign is a strategic container with a name, a color, and mission continuity fields (`currentMission` and `previousMission`). In board mode, campaigns are ordered entities rather than spatial ones. They still carry legacy coordinate fields in state for compatibility with older payloads, but the renderer no longer depends on those coordinates to determine display. Campaign color is still preserved in stored and imported data for compatibility, yet direct color editing is intentionally removed from the board UI because the interface now uses one global accent system. Mission continuity is now explicit by design: editing mission text only updates `currentMission`, while history advances only when the user deliberately marks the mission as done from the campaign action menu.

The second core entity is the project. A project represents executable or trackable work and can belong to one or many campaigns. Launchable projects hold a link or URI and can be opened directly from the board. Physical projects are deliberately non-launchable, allowing real-world artifacts to remain in the same model without fake URLs. When a project belongs to multiple campaigns, the same project appears in each relevant campaign section as an intentional duplicate view.

A third entity type is the device preference record. This stores local behavior decisions that should not propagate with shared map state, most notably whether standard web URLs should open in the current browser or attempt an Edge handoff. This separation keeps collaboration-safe data distinct from personal machine ergonomics.

# Geography

At the root, `manifest.json` declares extension metadata, permissions, the pinned extension `key`, and the new-tab override. The key is now a sync-critical artifact, because changing it would mint a different extension ID and therefore a separate `chrome.storage.sync` namespace. The page shell lives in `newtab.html`. That shell defines a collapsible left sidebar with always-visible core and utility actions, starts in a collapsed state by default so the board remains the first visual focus, provides a main board container with six uniform campaign slots rendered by JavaScript, and includes an inline panel root for create/edit/import/export workflows plus a hidden file input used for JSON imports.

Visual structure is implemented in `styles/newtab.css`. The stylesheet establishes spacing tokens, sidebar behavior, board grid geometry, campaign card hierarchy, project row rhythm, and panel styling. It intentionally encodes uniform section behavior so rendering remains clean under dense text and mixed project membership. The sidebar boundary system now uses one clear hand-drawn outer frame plus restrained divider lines between groups, while the action rows use icon-led highlight affordances instead of boxed buttons. In collapsed mode, labels are hidden and monochrome icons remain available for one-click actions. The board also uses content-adaptive row sizing so campaign cards no longer carry unnecessary vertical dead space. Campaign cards now enforce a minimum width floor in the two-column grid, maintain a baseline height floor, and then grow vertically with project volume instead of clipping project content. The grid is aligned to non-stretched, content-sized cards so row height follows actual campaign content rather than fixed visual tracks. Project lists no longer scroll inside cards; each card expands so project rows remain visually inside the border. The same file defines collapsed-sidebar behavior, slightly larger non-heading typography and icon sizing for proportional readability, and responsive rules that preserve card readability on narrower widths.

Runtime behavior is coordinated in `src/main.js`. This module initializes state and preferences, wires user interactions, renders the six-slot board, handles inline edits, opens project and campaign forms, and drives import/export/google-sync scaffold panels. It also owns persistence timing through debounced saves and storage subscriptions so multiple windows remain consistent.

Board-shaping helpers live in `src/layout.js`. In the current architecture, this module no longer computes coordinates. Instead, it derives visible campaigns, constructs fixed slot assignments, and builds campaign-to-project groupings for rendering. The domain model lives in `src/model.js`, which normalizes payloads, enforces invariants, applies mutations, and now enforces the six-campaign cap. Persistence adapters are split into `src/storage.js` for shared map state and `src/devicePrefs.js` for local machine preferences. Transfer concerns are isolated in `src/transfer.js`, and deferred cloud status plus runtime diagnostics are exposed by `src/googleSync.js`.

Supporting product context remains in `README.md` and `docs/`. `README.md` explains operator-facing usage and current sync boundaries. `docs/V1_SPEC.md` and `docs/VISION.md` capture implementation scope and longer-term direction.

# Flow

When a new tab opens, `newtab.html` loads `src/main.js`. Initialization loads synchronized map state and local device preferences in parallel. The incoming state is normalized through `src/model.js`, then applied as the in-memory source of truth for rendering. Rendering itself is deterministic: `src/layout.js` creates a six-slot view model, `src/main.js` renders each slot as either an active campaign card or an empty placeholder, and project lists are generated by campaign membership. The board is locked to exactly two campaign columns across the available width, and additional campaigns are reached through downward scrolling, but each card row now adapts to content height within a minimum floor.

Editing flow is split by complexity. Campaign title edits happen inline, and mission edits now use a compact highlighted strip without a heavy surrounding box; contextual guidance is delivered via tooltip text while the field still commits on blur through model mutation helpers. Mission lifecycle actions are intentionally separated from free text edits through a small per-campaign options menu: “Mark Mission Done” moves the current mission into history and clears the active mission field, while “Clear Mission History” removes historical mission text without touching the current one. The mission menu also guards pointer interactions locally so a mission-field blur re-render cannot swallow mission-action clicks, and mission actions read the latest in-editor mission draft before mutating state so completion/history operations always apply to current text. Sidebar utility actions remain one-click visible under the primary actions, including browser-target switching, export, import, and Google sync scaffold actions. The Google Sync panel now doubles as an operational diagnostic surface by showing the current extension ID, active state backend, and cloud-sync scaffold status so users can quickly detect extension-ID mismatches between devices. The sidebar initializes collapsed on each new tab; in that mode these actions remain accessible as icon-only controls, and expanding the sidebar reveals full labels for discoverability. The campaign summary in the sidebar is rendered as compact tokens (`c`, `p`, `m`) while full text remains in accessibility metadata. Campaign creation assigns a fixed accent-compatible color value into model state for backward compatibility, but color is no longer exposed as an interactive control in the board header. Project creation and editing use the panel form because project mode, link type, and campaign memberships require structured controls, while each campaign card renders project entries in a two-column chip grid with a minimal `+` add control beside the projects heading and compact inline edit icons embedded in each project pill. Launching a project depends on mode: launchable entries open links, while physical entries produce a local explanatory tooltip.

Transfer flow is explicit and defensive. Export serializes a versioned payload containing map data only. Import reads JSON text, validates envelope and version, normalizes the incoming state, and presents a replace-all confirmation that compares current and incoming campaign/project counts before any mutation occurs. Invalid imports stop at panel messaging and do not change state. Background synchronization flow continues through storage subscriptions: remote state updates are normalized and applied without forcing page refresh. When users migrate from older unpacked installs with divergent extension IDs, the architecture relies on a one-time export/import handoff under the new pinned ID to re-anchor future automatic sync.

# Philosophy

The architecture now prioritizes legibility guarantees over free-form map expression. Earlier spatial rendering offered flexibility but made cleanliness fragile under real-world text lengths and mixed memberships. The six-slot board makes the visual contract explicit: every campaign gets a stable container, every project has a consistent row treatment, and no interaction can degrade into geometric collision chaos.

Boundaries between concerns remain deliberate. Domain integrity is kept in `src/model.js`, board composition in `src/layout.js`, and browser-side integration in `src/main.js`. This separation keeps changes local: visual rework can happen in CSS and renderer code without mutating persistence semantics, and future sync upgrades can replace the Google scaffold without re-architecting campaign/project interaction. The pinned manifest key also reflects this philosophy by moving sync identity concerns into configuration rather than scattering ID assumptions through runtime logic.
The editorial redesign follows the same philosophy. Typography, color, spacing, and interaction restraint are implemented as a system of tokens and component rules, which keeps the interface warm and assured without introducing decorative complexity into runtime logic.

The final tradeoff is practical and intentional. Ops Map gives up infinite canvas behavior in exchange for predictability, readability, and maintenance simplicity. Within this constraint, the product still preserves key flexibility through multi-campaign project membership, inline editing, and portable export/import workflows.
